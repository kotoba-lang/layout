  "Where the bytes of an aggregate go, planned against a real machine.

  The canonical example: a particle with `x y z mass`. Held as an array of
  structs, a pass that reads only `x` still pulls `y z mass` into every cache
  line it touches. Held as a struct of arrays, `x` is contiguous and the line
  is all payload. Neither is universally right — a pass that touches *every*
  field of one element wants the struct back — so this namespace does not
  pick a winner in the abstract. It computes what each layout costs for a
  stated access pattern on a stated machine, and reports the model it used.

  Two things here are not decoration.

  **The cost model is a value.** `cost` returns `:cost/model` alongside the
  numbers, and `recommend` returns the losers as well as the winner. A layout
  choice whose justification cannot be printed is how a team ends up with an
  optimization nobody can re-derive and nobody dares delete.

  **Reordering fields breaks the ABI.** Sorting fields by descending
  alignment is the standard way to squeeze padding out of a struct, and it
  changes the byte offsets that `kotoba-wasm`'s Canonical ABI fixes by
  declaration order. So every plan carries `:layout/abi-canonical?` and
  `:layout/scope`, and `abi-guard!` throws rather than letting an
  internal-only layout leak across a component boundary. Silently shipping a
  reordered struct through a Canonical ABI lift is a wire-format bug that
  presents as data corruption.

  Pure `.cljc`. Depends only on `kotoba-lang/machine`."

  **Do not derive both inputs from the run you are explaining.** Taking
  `loop-ns-per-element` from the candidate arm and `bandwidth-bytes-per-ns`
  from the baseline arm makes this reproduce those two timings by
  construction — an identity dressed as a prediction, and it was reported as
  a successful validation here on 2026-08-03 before the circularity was
  noticed. To actually test the model, measure the loop floor on a working
  set that fits in L1 (where memory is free) and the bandwidth on a streaming
  read, then predict an unseen configuration.

  Both are measurements, so this returns a ceiling you can check against a
  `perfgate` claim rather than a number to quote."
